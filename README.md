# cfs (Cloud File System)


Initial Implementation plan:
- read URL from arguments
- do regular expression for URL, PORT, PATH
- wget clone
- read within anchor <a> and </a>
- display list


Ideas:
- wget clone
- read config file with linux path and URL
- detect local linux path, read URL
- Use wget to download index file
- read within anchor <a> and </a>
- display data
